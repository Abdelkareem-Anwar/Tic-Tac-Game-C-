# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This program implements a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++.

## Instructions

1. **Compile the Code:** Use a C++ compiler to compile the code.
2. **Run the Executable:** Execute the compiled binary file to start the game.
3. **Gameplay:** Players take turns by entering a number (1-9) to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') on the board.
4. **Win Condition:** The game ends when a player gets three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal or when the board is full.

## How to Play

- **Player 1 ('X') starts the game.**
- **Enter a number (1-9) to place your symbol on the grid.**
- **Alternate Turns:** The game will switch between Player 1 ('X') and Player 2 ('O').
- **Victory:** The first player to get three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Code Overview

### Functions

- `Draw()`: Displays the Tic-Tac-Toe grid to show the current game state.
- `inputs()`: Allows users to input their moves by placing 'X' or 'O' on the grid.
- `change_player()`: Alternates the player's turn after each move.
- `win()`: Checks for a winning condition to determine the winner.

### How to Run

1. **Compile:** Use a C++ compiler to compile the code (e.g., `g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe`).
2. **Execute:** Run the compiled executable to start the game (`./tic_tac_toe`).
